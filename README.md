# Ghosty Engine 2D

It was made for my 2D Game project and decided to work on it more

## Features:
> Import PNG's to create walls for your game
> Has a special export format named .xzenp for later modifications
> It has built in Room system already with options of " Next Door  " & " Back Door " and a Default Spawnpoint

## Roadmap:
> Rework on the code to implement more features
> Ready to use .py files for the walls you create for your room aswell for doors
> Built-in player movement once you upload your sprite you just need to define which frames are walk/jump/run/left/right/down and up movements.

## Planned: 
- **Extensions for plugin support:** although they will run as seperated process but i do plan to make them run built in...somehow
and yes 3rd party plugins will be allowed.

- **Room system rework:** to add support more than in and out door options.


## How it works:
You basically import any PNG image and you draw on it the output is saved as " mask.png " (can be renamed)
after that you just have to implement a detection system on your own **for now.** 
_*later on you'll be provided an auto-generated code for your own room so you dont have to bother with the detections and doors aswell so wait future updates**_


- **If you want to contribute feel free it's very time consuming to work on this on my own considering i have a lot to do irl and study for my school it is really hard**
